================================================================================
One-time DhanHQ OAuth setup script.
================================================================================

WHAT THIS DOES (read this first if you have never run it)
---------------------------------------------------------
DhanHQ's "API Key + API Secret" auth flow produces a 12-month access token
through a 3-step OAuth process. Two of those three steps happen here in
code; the middle step requires you to log in via a browser (DhanHQ does
this for security so they can show you the standard login page).

This script walks you through the whole thing and writes the resulting
access token back into the `.env` file that sits next to it (i.e.
`Dependencies/.env`). After that, the Streamlit scanner app reads the token
from that `.env` automatically -- no more copy-pasting 24-hour JWTs from
web.dhan.co every morning.

WHEN TO RUN THIS SCRIPT
-----------------------
- Once after you first generate the API Key / API Secret pair on
  web.dhan.co (My Profile -> DhanHQ Trading APIs -> Generate API).
- Again whenever the 12-month access token eventually expires.
- Again if you regenerate the API Key / Secret for any reason.

WHAT YOU NEED FIRST (before running this)
-----------------------------------------
Open `Dependencies/.env` and fill in:
    DHAN_CLIENT_CODE       <- your 10-digit dhan client id
    DHAN_API_KEY           <- the API Key  (also called "app_id"  in DhanHQ docs)
    DHAN_API_SECRET        <- the API Secret (also called "app_secret")
Leave DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN blank; this script populates it for you.

HOW TO RUN THIS SCRIPT
----------------------
From the scanner app root, run:
    python Dependencies/dhan_token_setup.py

The script prints a login URL. Open it in any browser, log in with your
Dhan credentials, and after a successful login DhanHQ will redirect you
to a URL that looks like:

    https://your-redirect/?tokenId=<long_random_string>

Copy the value after `tokenId=` (or the whole URL, the script tolerates
both) and paste it into the prompt. The script then exchanges that
short-lived `tokenId` for the 12-month `accessToken` and writes it into
the local `.env`.

THE 3 OAUTH STEPS, EXPLAINED FOR BEGINNERS
------------------------------------------
1. We tell DhanHQ "this app (identified by its API Key + Secret) wants to
   start a login session." DhanHQ replies with a temporary `consentAppId`.
2. The user opens a browser, signs in to DhanHQ, and approves the consent.
   DhanHQ redirects the browser to a URL containing a `tokenId`.
3. The user pastes that `tokenId` back into this script. We send it +
   our API Key/Secret back to DhanHQ. If everything matches up, DhanHQ
   returns the long-lived `accessToken`.

This dance is essentially the same OAuth pattern you have probably seen
when granting a third-party app access to your Google or GitHub account.
The browser step exists so you can see what is being authorised and
explicitly approve it -- credentials never live inside this script.
